# Control-Alt-Defeat---2021
Hackathon project for the theme of connection. Basic social media in visual C#.

This is a social media platform that we created that lets fellow Cougs to connect with each other. We used visual C# to create GUI's that are easy to use and navigate so 
that new users can join the platform and use it without issues. 

The user starts by creating an account. They will then enter all of their information and select next. The program will remember their sign in info so that they can sign in 
later if they wish to do so. 

They will then be brought to their profile page where they can choose to discover new people as well as add new friends. They are also allowed to message their friends and
receive responses. Then the user can decide to sign out and when they come back to sign in again, the program will remember their sign in info and allow them to sign in. 

We made this as a team together using visual studio live share.
